Non-office workers experience a significantly higher number, 1.6 million more, of workplace injuries resulting in days away from work than office workers. This is expected as industrial and manufacturing jobs involve more physical labor and dangerous environments. However, office workers still account for a large number of injury cases of 630,237 cases. This number suggests that office safety policies are still important.

Figure 2 illustrates the difference between injury cases for office and non-office workers. Figure 2 emphasizes the disparity between the two groups and shows the need for potential safety acts.

However, office workers fall at a higher rate of .22 compared to non-office workers .19 when taken proportionally. Additionally, the severity of falls that office workers experience are worse than non-office workers. When looking at figure 4 you can also see that office workers miss more 50 days of work on average when falls occur. This result could be due to ergonomic issues or lack of safety training.

## Methods

### Data Sources

This report uses data published by the **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)** for the year 2021â€“2022. Three main tables were used:

- **Table R10**: Injury cases by event or exposure and age
- **Table R64**: Injury cases by nature of injury and occupation
- **Table R67**: Injury cases by event or exposure and occupation

These tables were accessed via the BLS website and downloaded in Excel format. The primary focus was on identifying:

- The **frequency** of injuries among office and non-office workers
- The **event type**, especially falls, slips, and trips
- The **severity**, measured by median days away from work

### Classification of Occupation Types

Occupations were categorized into two groups:

- **Office workers**: administrative assistants, accountants, customer service, clerical roles, and similar
- **Non-office workers**: construction, transportation, installation, maintenance, manufacturing, and related labor-intensive roles

Classification was based on title keyword matching and manual review of BLS categories.

### Data Preparation

The analysis was conducted in R. Data cleaning steps included:

1. Importing each Excel sheet
2. Standardizing column names and formats
3. Filtering for rows where injury data were available
4. Mapping occupations to either "Office" or "Non-office"

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Example: Reading and cleaning R67 data
data_r67 <- read_excel("case-and-demographic-characteristics-table-r67-2021-2022.xlsx", skip = 4)

data_cleaned <- data_r67 %>%
  filter(!is.na(...1)) %>%
  rename(Occupation = ...1) %>%
  mutate(Type = case_when(
    grepl("(Administrative|Clerical|Accountant|Receptionist|Customer Service)", Occupation, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Office",
    TRUE ~ "Non-office"
  ))
```

### Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were computed to summarize total injuries and injury types by occupation type. Proportional rates of falls and median days away from work were calculated to assess severity. Data were visualized using bar plots and boxplots in `ggplot2`.

Limitations include potential underreporting of injuries and ambiguity in occupation classification. Future studies could incorporate more granular occupational data or employer-specific logs for improved accuracy.
