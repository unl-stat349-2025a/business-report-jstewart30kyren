Safety in the workplace is a problem primarily associated with industrial and manufacturing environments due to the straining nature of physical labor and exposure to dangerous machinery and hazardous substances. However, recent discoveries examining office-related injuries challenge the notion that office environments are inherently low-risk. An article written by Aftermath claims that office workers are surprisingly susceptible to injuries, particularly slips, trips, and falls. These injuries can result in prolonged absences from work and significant costs to employers, especially if workers' compensation is involved.
In response, this report evaluates the risks of workplace injuries between office and non-office workers using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) through record-keeping logs kept by employers throughout the year. By comparing the probability and severity of injuries in both settings, this analysis aims to determine whether more safety protocols should be implemented in office environments to reduce overlooked risks.

End of Intro





While in this report, it is true that non-office workers experience a substantially higher number of workplace injuries, 1.6 million more annually, than their office counterparts, the analysis reveals that office environments present significant safety risks. With over 630,000 injury cases reported among office workers and a higher proportional rate of falls (.22 vs .19), the data highlights the need for greater attention to office safety measures. Additionally, falls in office settings are more severe and result in longer recovery times, averaging over 50 additional days away than non-office workers.
The findings in this report suggest that office environments are not immune to serious injuries. These injuries can result from ergonomic issues, like office chair discomfort, or from a lack of fall prevention measures. A review of existing office safety policies and employee training is recommended to protect office staff and reduce downtime due to preventable injuries.
The reportâ€™s results may be limited due to the underreporting of injuries on the job. Employees may consider injuries to be insignificant and do not report them. Additionally, some sectors may have different safety protocols. Compared to an office setting, manufacturing sectors will typically have stricter safety protocols due to union and OSHA oversight.
