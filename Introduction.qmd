Workplace injuries and illnesses are a significant public health and economic concern in the United States. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), private industry employers reported nearly 2.6 million nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses in 2022 alone, leading to substantial lost productivity, healthcare costs, and long-term disability [@bureauoflaborstatisticsIIFHome]. These injuries affect workers' quality of life and burden employers through workers' compensation claims and reduced labor availability. As the nature of work continues to evolve, accurately assessing and mitigating occupational injury risks has become more important for occupational safety professionals and employers.

Traditionally, most occupational health research has concentrated on physically demanding, goods-producing (non-office) industries such as construction, manufacturing, and natural resources. These sectors are often characterized by higher rates of severe injuries due to the physical nature of the work, the use of heavy equipment, and exposure to hazardous environments. As a result, they have become the primary focus of safety interventions and regulatory enforcement. In contrast, service-providing industries (office-based) jobs are frequently perceived as safer due to the lower presence of overt physical hazards. This perception has influenced the allocation of resources and research attention, leaving potential risks in non-manual labor settings underexplored. The unexplored research limits the understanding of occupational risk in the modern economy, where the majority of workers are now employed in service-oriented roles. This study aims to explore this gap in research through a broad, data-driven analysis of injury patterns across both industry types.

The study utilizes publicly available datasets from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, specifically datasets R65 and R75, to compare occupational injury risks between office and non-office work. R65 contains the number of nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses involving days away from work sorted by industry. R75 provides rates categorized by the event or exposure leading to injury. Non-office and office work are categorized into "goods-producing" (e.g., construction, manufacturing) and "service-providing" (e.g., education, healthcare, professional services) groups based on BLS classifications. Using descriptive statistics, visualizations, and comparative analysis, this study illustrates differences in injury likelihood and severity across sectors.

By comparing injury risk across industry groups, this research contributes new insights into occupational safety in office and non-office environments and challenges the assumption that office work is low-risk. The findings have practical implications for redefining safety protocols, workplace ergonomics policies, and broadening the scope of occupational health surveillance in a labor market increasingly dominated by service employment.
